* NoProcessEmptyBody
- dummy algorithm with NO body
- only possible with P syntax
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK
- doens't parse in Toolbox

* NoProcessNoLabel
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and No label
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK

* NoProcessOneLabel
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and ONE label
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK

* NoProcessTwoLabels
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and TWO labels
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK

* OneProcessEmptyThreadP
- dummy algorithm with ONE processes with EMPTY body
- only possible with P syntax (?)
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK
- doens't parse in Toolbox

* OneProcessOneThread (one process instance or n process instances)
- dummy algorithm with ONE process and ONE/TWO labels
- should produce the same code (except for pc) with distpcal flag or not - OK

* TwoProcessesOneThread2C
- dummy algorithm with TWO processes (1 and n instances) and one thread
- TODO: check wtihout flag

* MultiProcessMultiThread1C
- dummy algorithm with TWO processes (1 and n instances), each with 2 threads
