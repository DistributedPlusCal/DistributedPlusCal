* NoProcessEmptyBody
- dummy algorithm with NO body
- only possible with P syntax
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK
- doens't parse in Toolbox

* NoProcessNoLabel
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and No label
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK

* NoProcessOneLabel
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and ONE label
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK

* NoProcessTwoLabels
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and TWO labels
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK


* OneProcessEmptyThreadP
- dummy algorithm with ONE processes with EMPTY body
- only possible with P syntax (?)
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK
- doens't parse in Toolbox


* OneProcessOneThread (one process instance or n process instances)
- dummy algorithm with ONE process and ONE/TWO labels
- should produce the same code (except for pc) with distpcal flag or not - OK

* OneProcessOneThread1sC
- as before but use string identifiers for processes


* OneProcessMultiThread
- with multiple threads
- C or P
- id in set

* OneProcessMultiThreadMC
- use macros
- and channel operations in the macros

* TwoProcessesOneThread2C
- dummy algorithm with TWO processes (1 and n instances) and one thread
- should produce the same code (except for pc) with distpcal flag or not - OK
- with distpcal flag:
  /\ \A self \in PROCSet : \A subprocess \in SubProcSet[self] : WF_vars(pid1(self))

* TwoProcessesOneThread2sC
- as before but use string identifiers for processes


* MultiProcessMultiThread1C
- dummy algorithm with TWO processes (1 and n instances), each with 2 threads
- parsed in Toolbox
- TLC OK



* Clash 
- dummy algorithm to check how fresh variables are generated 
-- in SubProcSet
-- in Init (for channels)
-- for read/clear operations
- should change fifo-channel to get the behaviour for both cases
- if declare variable _n430 we get a parse error 
  (but no problem for _c159)
- parsed
- TLC OK (deadlock)
	
* ClashNoChannel
- same as Clash but no channels

* Clash2D
- originally for testing fresh variables
- uses bidimensional channels 
- has multiple threads


* VarAndChannelDecls1C
- testing channel/fifo declarations local to processes
- parsed
- bug (general) for the initialization -> unidimensional array generated
- funny translation for fifos if send/receive are not atomic 
  (without Snd2 and Rcv2); doesn't work for channels (because of cur
  receiver twice)

* Procedures
- 0p -> uniprocess
- 1p1s -> one process / one thread
- 1p2t -> one process / two threads
- both use the same procedure
- Rec -> recursive procedure, no channels

* ProceduresWithLV
- procedures using process local variables
- parses but error in TLC (with or without distpcal)
- ProceduresWithLVprocId: use local variables from unique process
- ProceduresWithLVprocSet: use local variables from process set

* FreshVars
- check how fresh variables are generated
- try to declare a variable that will be freshly generated (eg _n42)
