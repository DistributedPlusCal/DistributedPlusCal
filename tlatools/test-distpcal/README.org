* Processes

** Test No Process
*** NoProcessNoLabel
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and No label
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK
*** NoProcessOneLabel
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and ONE label
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK
*** NoProcessTwoLabels
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and TWO labels
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK
*** NoProcessNoLabelMacro
- dummy algorithm with NO processes and a macro
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK


** Test One Process
*** OneProcessOneThread (C & P)
- dummy algorithm with ONE process
- uses local variable
- should produce the same code (except for pc) with distpcal flag or not - OK
*** OneProcessOneThreadStringId (C & P)
- as OneProcessOneThread but use string identifiers for processes
- generates two labels
*** OneProcessMultiThread (C & P)
- one process with multiple threads
- process id explicit (not in set)
- C or P
*** OneProcessMultiThreadLocalVar (C & P)
- as OneProcessMultiThread but with a local variable to the process
*** OneProcessSetMultiThread (C & P)
- one process definition
- process ids from Set 
*** OneProcessSetMultiThreadXalt (C & P)
- same as OneProcessSetMultiThread but the set of Nodes is a parameter
  (for tests)
*** OneProcessEmptyThreadP (P)
- dummy algorithm with ONE processes with EMPTY body
- only possible with P syntax (?)
- should produce the same code with distpcal flag or not - OK
- doesn't parse in Toolbox
