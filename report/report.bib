abstract="TLA+ is a specification language for concurrent and reactive systems that combines the temporal logic TLA with full first-order logic and ZF set theory. TLC is a new model checker for debugging a TLA+ specification by checking invariance properties of a finite-state model of the specification. It accepts a subclass of TLA+ specifications that should include most descriptions of real system designs. It has been used by engineers to find errors in the cache coherence protocol for a new Compaq multiprocessor. We describe TLA+ specifications and their TLC models, how TLC works, and our experience using it.",
